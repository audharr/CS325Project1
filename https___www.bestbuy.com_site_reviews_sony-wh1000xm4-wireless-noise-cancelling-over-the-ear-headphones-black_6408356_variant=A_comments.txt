If you aren’t planning on spending 500 dollars on a pair of Airpods max this is the best option available. 

Pros:
-Easy controls in-app on Android or iPhone.
-Wired option. (Aux)
-All-day battery.
-GREAT bass and mid-tones.
-Solid build quality.
-Comfortable during standard use.
-Noise canceling is way better than any other headphones I’ve used (better than ANY airpods).

Cons:
-Treble is slightly lacking compared to bass (still sound amazing).
-Touch controls are difficult and iffy.
-A little chunky(if you like to lay down while using headphone they’re pretty uncomfortable).
-Transparency mode SUCKS compared to airpods pros but on their own its fine enough not to bother me.

I love using these headphones, the only reason I didn’t leave five stars was because of the transparency mode.

The Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones are nothing short of a game-changer in the world of audio. Having used them extensively over the past few months, I can confidently say they live up to—and even exceed—their reputation.

Sound Quality:

Whether you’re in a noisy café or a quiet room, the sound experience remains consistently immersive.

Noise Cancellation:
Sony’s noise-cancelling technology is among the best available. The WH-1000XM4 effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing you to focus on your music, podcasts, or calls without distraction. The noise-cancelling can be customized to suit your environment, and there’s even a feature that lets in ambient sounds when needed, ensuring you stay aware of your surroundings when required.

Battery Life:
The battery life of these headphones is exceptional. With up to 30 hours of playback on a single charge, they easily outlast a full day of use. The quick charge feature is a lifesaver, giving you up to 5 hours of playback from just a 10-minute charge.

Additional Features:
The WH-1000XM4 is packed with features that enhance the overall experience. The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to manage your music and calls. The voice assistant integration works seamlessly, allowing for hands-free operation. Plus, the Speak-to-Chat feature automatically pauses your music when you start speaking, then resumes playback once you’re done.

Conclusion:
In summary, the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones are a standout product that sets a new benchmark for high-end headphones. Their combination of superior sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and remarkable comfort make them a worthwhile investment for any audio enthusiast.

I’ve been on the hunt for the best work out headphones and when I tell you I’ve been running back and forth to Best Buy three times in the past two weeks. These are the best ones to purchase because of the research I did for the best recommended ones in the market after my last two attempts at finding “the one” mind you, I’m not an electronics person but I was looking to become physically healthy again and needed to find the right tools that will help me make it fun.

I first purchased the Beats by Dre fit pro - I brought them to the gym and everything was fine at first but I noticed they hurt my ears because the buds that pop in are so thick and it always felt like it would fall out of my ears. After the second time in the gym, the right side completely stopped working and I had to return them. However, I did really like the noise cancelling feature and base in them. They weren’t waterproof as I had thought or they may have been defective.

Fortunately I returned them and purchased the AirPod pros 3rd generation. I thought they would be better because I have an iPhone and the sound was great once you customize it but it would literally NOT fit in my ear/it kept popping out and I know I could’ve ordered these silicone tips to make them fit but it’s so inconvenient to have to carry two separate cases and pop the silicone on and off every time I use them. Plus, someone else said even with them on they still wouldn’t stay put.

At my wits end, I looked on TikTok what everyone recommended and compared - I somehow landed on reviews for these Sony headphones and I’m glad I took a chance. I also recommend you look at the videos to get a more detailed review on them. I took them to the gym and they stayed put! Yes I also sweat on them because I was running and walking on the treadmill for 60 minutes straight and they are still working. They are easy to clean because the padding is a harder leather like material and they are soo soft! It’s like a cloud over my ears. I love that it also folds together, and is adjustable - it hugs your head nice and snug without giving you a headache.

The noise cancellation on them is impeccable! I can barely hear anything else outside of them when I turn them on and I find the “touchscreen-like” controls on the side useful instead of having to tap a button and being unsure if they were pushed hard enough. It makes running on the treadmill so much easier as well as keeping them clean when my hands are sweaty. I love how I can swipe in different ways to move the controls (Up=louder/Down=lower volume/double tap=pause/swipe right&left two times skips songs or goes forward) and the most useful control is covering your ear over the headphone and it will disable the noise cancellation if someone/something needs your immediate attention.

The battery life lasts so long. I was using them for an hour and they are still at full battery. It doesn’t take long to charge them either! I love that these headphones look aesthetically pleasing it comes in black and grey (I bought the grey because they also look beige/nude/neutral colored to me) it’s the right balance between not too skinny & not too bulky. They come with their own protective case and a bunch of extra things like a plug for an airplane, a wire if you want to connect it to your phone I think, and it’s charging cable.

I recommend these headphones completely as I have also found out my supervisor has the same ones but in the color black which is awesome and makes me feel like I made the right choice. I definitely won’t be going back to Best Buy for a return on these. I recommend you always purchase the coverage on any headphones you buy so that you’re covered if you buy any that just don’t work for you.

TLDR: 
-I’ve been back & forth trying to find the best headphones 
-Noise cancelling & touch screen like controls
-Perfect for the gym especially on the treadmill
-Cloud like cushion/Easy to clean/No headache 
-Long battery life/Short charge time
-Great base and music
-Comes with protective case and wires
-Sleek & aesthetically pleasing neutral colors
-Sweat proof
-Always buy the care coverage so you can return them if it doesn’t work for you 

Yes they are a bit pricy but it is worth every penny. Some prefer this over the AirPod Max because of the case, quality, and it looks better overall. Mind you the AirPod Max is $400+

I recently acquired the Sony WH1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones in Silver, and I am utterly impressed with the audio quality, comfort, and advanced features that these headphones offer.

First and foremost, the noise-canceling capability of the WH1000XM4 is nothing short of exceptional. It effortlessly drowns out ambient noise, creating a serene listening environment. Whether I'm on a noisy commute, working in a bustling coffee shop, or flying, the headphones effectively block out unwanted sound, allowing me to immerse myself fully in my music or podcasts.

The sound quality itself is outstanding. The headphones deliver a rich, detailed audio experience with deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The immersive soundstage makes every genre of music come alive, providing a truly enjoyable listening experience. The LDAC support ensures high-quality wireless audio streaming, maintaining the integrity of the audio even when listening via Bluetooth.

Comfort is a key factor for me in choosing headphones, and the WH1000XM4 excels in this department. The plush ear cups and headband make extended listening sessions a breeze. The ergonomic design not only provides a secure fit but also contributes to effective noise isolation. I can wear these headphones for hours without any discomfort.

The touch-sensitive controls on the ear cups add a touch of sophistication to the user experience. Adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and taking calls are all easily managed with intuitive gestures. The inclusion of sensors that automatically pause playback when the headphones are removed and resume when worn again is a thoughtful feature that enhances convenience.

The battery life of the WH1000XM4 is impressive, offering hours of playback on a single charge. The quick charge feature is a lifesaver for those moments when you need a boost in a hurry.

Sony's Headphones Connect app further enhances the WH1000XM4 experience. Customizable EQ settings, adaptive sound control, and firmware updates can all be conveniently managed through the app.

In conclusion, the Sony WH1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones in Silver are a true standout in the realm of premium headphones. With their unparalleled noise-canceling technology, superb audio quality, and luxurious comfort, they are an investment in a superior audio experience.

Hi LananhD, Thanks for sharing your detailed feedback. We are glad that you like the features and capabilities of your new Sony WH1000XM4 wireless noise canceling headphones. Thank you for your purchase. Enjoy! Vincent
So...Headphones are what you're looking for? Well, if you have an Android Phone, there really isn't anything to talk about. I don't care what you put up against this Xm4...they all fall. Sound quality is unmatched by anything I have heard in earphones or headphones by all the top brands like Sennheiser, Bose, Master and dynamics, and others. The comfort is better or at the very least equal to anything you have tried. The battery life is better than anything ever made for headphones period. Headphones have Multiple Device support unlike the majority of the headphones and earphones out there. The unit reads your text messages for goodness sake. They are lightweight and feel amazing in the hands or on your head. The Volume power is among the very best I've heard too. And finally at the price of under $300 you can't tell me you can find better.

If you are on the Autism spectrum, and/or have a sensory processing disorder, my review is for you. Sensory processing disorder is difficult for many to understand (Some people say the phrase "Sensory sensitivity" instead of processing disorder). These headphones were a Christmas gift from my parents who live in another state, so I took this attached photo as my facial expression the first time I turned on the ANC.

I am on the autism spectrum and I have a sensory processing disorder. I work as a business data analyst for a fortune 25 company working with big datasets, building dashboards, ect. I really struggled in my job with the "Open floor plan" with cubicles everywhere. All the noise of the office was so overwhelming when I was trying to write complex formulas in Excel and Tableau, or complex SQL database queries. I would lose my place and have to start over. This was beyond frustrating. When we switched to work from home, I thought it would be great. All the noise of the office is gone!

That was until a family moved into the apartment above mine with 3 kids who like jumping off the bed and playing basketball in the house (yikes).  The problem for people with a sensory processing disorder is that we need periods of "silence" sometimes too, so even though my non ANC headphones (Sony MDR-7506s) were really nice, they required me to have music at a decent volume to try and block out the sound above me. Not with these new Sony WH-1000XM4s! I can activate the noise canceling without playing music, and it works! I had read a review that said it would auto-shut off after 10 minutes if you didn't play any music, but so far I haven't had that problem (as long as they are within bluetooth range of my phone still, as they will "sleep" if there is no bluetooth connection).

These guys helped me SO MUCH. Not only can I not hear the noise upstairs, but I can also hear myself think and I can relax. The way these headphones compensate for your ear canal and atmospheric pressure is absolutely mind blowing. The silence is golden.

As a final note to help those who don't have a sensory processing disorder, but might be considering these for a loved one, I have a quick story about my first time wearing them. With a sensory processing disorder, if a single sensation is "overwhelming" your brain, you are actually not capable of processing other sensations. Before getting these headphones, I had been told by multiple people that my dog had a weird smell, but I absolutely could not smell it. After just a few minutes of wearing these headphones (with no music playing, but with ANC on) I started smelling my dog. It was the most weird sensation to realize my SPD was preventing me from smelling my dog just because of the noise upstairs. ANC technology is live changing for someone with SPD, and these are the best in the industry for ANC. The music is great too (and yes I do use them for music sometimes as well) but if you are considering these for someone on the Autism Spectrum or with a sensory processing disorder, they are fantastic for that too, even with no music on.

Thank you Sony, from the bottom of my heart. These are life changing and I'm so thankful. God bless.
Hi PR0XIDIAN, Thank you for taking the time to review the WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones. Intelligent and intuitive, the WH-1000XM4 headphones offer further improvements to our industry-leading noise cancelation, exceptional sound quality, and smart listening that adjusts to your behavior and your location. Using the Sony Headphones Connect app, Ambient Sound Control lets you adjust the volume of background sound and gives you the option to allow voices alone to be heard. Meanwhile, the Equalizer lets you customize sound levels to suit your music. Thank you for giving the product a perfect rating! Jay
Firstly I bought these earphones so I can pair them to my Sony TV when I'm watching TV late at night (my attempts to he considerate to other members of the house). They paired wonderfully, seamlessly,  and didnt have that weird crackling/static noise i was getting when Paired other Bluetooth earbuds. I was impressed with the sound that I use them for listening to music while im working from home. They sound amazing! The bass is nice. The mids and the highes are awesome, too. Its not the punchy bass like my scullcandy earbuds,  but there is a reason for that. Earbuds are directly in your ear canal and creates a seal, allowing for all the pressure to be forsed into your ear. These earphones work a bid differently and present the Vibration of the bass, but the pressure from the bass is disbursed around your ear. So, the bass is present,  its just not punching your eardrums (its a good thing).  These earphones are super light. If it wasnt for the heat that builds up around your ear, you wouldn't be able to tell you have them on. I do have to take them off and let my ears breathe and to bring my body temperature down a bit. I never knew how important of a role our ears played in regulating body temperature.  the noice canceling is amazing. It truly blocks out everything.  The ambient noice feature works great as well. I turned off the automatic feature for this because if I start singing or clear my throat, it pauses the music to let outside noises in. But, I do like that it pauses the music or video when i take them off and resumes when i put them back on.  The battery life? OMG! 30 hours is so much play time that ive done a week without charging them!!! Ive never run out of battery, so I have the freedom of not really worrying about them at all. When I remember to charge them, I do. But, the battery life is so amazing that I can do it whenever i remember to do it. I opted for the silver/putty color, over the black. Black conceals dirt more easily and didn't want to be bothered with that. I like to keep things clean and since these headphones are going over two big holes in my head, I want something thats going to show dirt, so i can get rid of it. They are easier to find in darker lit rooms, which is a plus for me since i have dark leather couches.  Dont want to accidentally sit on them and break them. I definitely recommend these. Would I pay full price for them? Probably not. I w9uld wait until they are on sale. Thats what I did and Im glad they were on sale when i decided to buy some headphone.

I was wanting to buy these headphones for a while and I’m so happy I did. They are so amazing and I love the way they look especially the rose gold accents. The sound quality is also amazing I listen to a lot of metal/oldies and my favorite songs sound wayyyy better now. The battery life on them are also great they last quite a long time. It’s also super easy to connect and disconnect them. I mostly use these when I’m painting or cleaning so I have no issues with it slipping off my head. One of the biggest concern I have was if they hurt your ears and I’m happy to see that I can wear them for basically a whole day straight and not have any ear fatigue. Overall 100% recommend! ( my dog seems so like them too)
Hi RosalindaZ, You've made a great choice! Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review of your new Sony WH1000XM4.

I'm in the scientific field and I need complete isolation from distractions when reading.

I tried to update my headphones to something noise canceling and comfortable and bought the Apple headphones. Tried them for a while, but they were not as expected. I triwd these ones and well, i would say they arenjust perfect. 

They are way cheaper and they deliver excellent sound. Theres an app you can download to set the headphones the way you want it.

They come with a wire to connect to your headphones and I have used it when I want to watch something on the plane movies' catalog, so I have good sound and noise canceling while watching the plane's movies. 

Overall, they simple, nice, lifht weight and deliver great sound, besides come with a case that it's very useful when I'm traveling.
Hi patadeperro, Awesome! We are so glad to hear that you are happy with your new WH1000XM4 headphones! Thank you so much for choosing Sony! -Carl
Very high quality headphones, don't regret my purchase. Comes in 3 color options which are all pretty good. I really like the comfort of them and ability to wear them all day without any irritation. 
I like the option of wire and wireless as well. Comes packaged nicely with a reusable case.
Hi Mari,Thank you for the 5-star rating! We're happy to hear that you like the comfortable design and quality of the headphones. Thank you for choosing Sony!-David
A present for my boyfriend but I have the same ones so I knew it was a good purchase. The sound quality on these is incredible and so is the noise canceling. I use them at the gym on my runs and to study for my classes. They’re so comfortable and the battery lasts me a week without charging.
Hi KianaH,This is definitely a great present for your boyfriend! Nice to hear you like the amazing sound, comfortable fit, noise cancellation, and long battery life of the WH1000XM4 headphones. Thanks for choosing Sony! - Kris
Love the Sony XM4 have been using them for over a year and haven’t experienced any issues with them would recommend for someone want’s a premium pair of headphones at a good price point.
Hi Tyler, we're glad you love our product. Thanks for choosing Sony! ~Earl
Unbeatable noise-cancellation quality and commendable audio quality make these the headphones to get when you need a quiet environment. Topping it all off is remarkable battery life (~30 hours). The main detriment is less than stellar connectivity options. It includes Sony's LDAC, but doesn't have any low-latency codecs.

I recently purchased the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones, and they have exceeded all my expectations! The noise cancellation is simply outstanding, immersing me in my own world of music without any distractions. The sound quality is top-notch, delivering rich bass, clear vocals, and crisp highs, making every track a delight to listen to.

I love the comfort they provide; the plush ear cups and adjustable headband ensure I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing me to manage my music and calls effortlessly.

Moreover, the battery life is impressive! I've used these headphones for long flights and never had to worry about running out of power. The multi-device connectivity is a great feature too, as I can seamlessly switch between my phone, laptop, and tablet.

Sony's additional features, like the speak-to-chat and Quick Attention mode, add further value and convenience to these headphones.

All in all, I highly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4 to any audiophiles or anyone who wants to experience the ultimate in noise-canceling technology and exceptional sound quality. You won't be disappointed!

I purchased these headphones a couple of months ago. I was actually intending to purchase a different pair of Sony over-ear headphones, but I'm so happy that I went with these! The sound quality is phenomenal. The padding on them is very comfortable, and the headphones sit well on my head. I love that you can really enjoy an immersive sound experience. It's great that you can adjust the EQ to your liking through the app. 
The battery is much better than any other headphones I've owned. They charge quickly and the battery isn't draining when the headphones are off. 
Connectivity is quick and seamless. It's also great that they come with wires, so you can easily connect them to airplanes without having to purchase anything extra. 
The case holds everything nicely and provides some decent padding to protect the headphones.
Hey YogiLady, perfect! You've certainly made a great choice! We're extremely pleased to know that you're very happy with your WH-1000XM4 and you're satisfied with its amazing sound quality, very comfortable fit design, customizable settings through the Sony | Headphones Connect app, long-lasting battery life, exceptional features, and superb performance. Thank you so much for sharing your excellent experience with our product and for choosing the best brand, Sony! - Romeo
I ordered these on a pre-black friday sale weeks before the main sales were announced on best buy. I had extensively researched the headphones (and previous generation XM3) for about 10 months prior to pulling the trigger, comparing them to literally everything else in its tranche and also more expensive models. This included audio-technica, bose, sennheiser, bowers & wilson, and bang & olufsen to name a few. I recommend these headphones over the others for several reasons:

1. Sound quality. The sound out of the box was not to my liking, but the beauty of the Sony app is that you can craft the EQ how you want. I was able to find a custom setting that enhances nearly all of the music I listen to. I'm very happy with the high quality sound across the board. Do not buy a NC headphone without the ability to tweak the EQ. Sound quality is a relative matter and you may be unhappy with the out-of-the-box sound if you opt for a cheaper model.

2. Noise canceling. Top-notch with a ton of features allowing for levels of ambient sound to your liking. Adaptive sound control is a huge plus

3. Functionality. Ability to connect to 2 devices simultaneously. Of course more would be great but at least 2 is crucial (which is why I would buy XM4 over XM3). I usually connect to my ipad and iphone and can seamlessly move between both.

4. Comfort. I previously owned a pair of Sennheisers which were very uncomfortable. I would give these XM4's 9/10 in terms of comfort. I will admit that it took me a few weeks to get used to the pressure but in finding the sweet spot (about 5 clicks up on the head band) I am now able to wear them for hours without needing to take them off.

5. Call quality. I've tested these with multiple family members and friends. They have all given these at least 9/10 in terms of call quality in moderate background sound environments. Will the call quality be the best on the market? Probably not, but personally I didn't buy these for calls. Rest assured, you'll be fine.

6. Style. I like the minimal design. They are matte black with a sleek non-offensive look which I actually like more than the Bose. I would say opt for the black over silver (almost a pewter grey) because over time they will show scratches and smudges less.

Conclusion. If you're on the fence, take a look a the many reviews on youtube especially the ones comparing models. I highly recommend you buy these over the probably cheaper XM3's (depending on when you view this). The added features are worth spending more, but good news is that these seem to routinely go on sale. Worth every penny for WFH, music lovers, and even calls. Enjoy :)

My first ever Luxury Headphone, it's been a couple of weeks and I have to say these are in all caps FANTASTIC! At first, I was hesitant of buying as I wanted new headphones for usage in my home as my pair of old Philip noise-canceling headphones died out after a few drops of water, (2016-2020) I was using Galaxy buds which are working by the way but I noticed they would run low on the battery once I get home from class, so I decided to get new headphones for home, I did my research and it seems as the Sony's xm4 is an extremely good choice then again, it was pricey for what they were until I made the bold move of getting them anyways, I could have gotten anything else, but now, these is what I got, and now looking back I have made the right call. 

Here are the things and detail I'll go over with this review:

-In terms of sounds, holy cow, I'm not an Audiophile but these sound incredible all around and very loud, it seems as nothing is left out, wired in when the headphone is plugged into a device while they are off, it's decent at best unless the equalizers are arranged to sound at best good, but when turned on, they sound exactly like they are in BlueTooth noise cancelation mode, fantastic, speaking of noise cancelation.

-The noise cancelation is superb seriously it actually made me have a little headache the first time using it without playing any music because it was blocking off so much noise. While playing music, all noises are blocked off but I haven't tested them in a super loud environment such as live band performance in restaurants or bars and in a motorsport racing event, well as of the time of typing that I can't that because of the pandemic which understandable but one thing it did well was blocking off my dad speaker he uses every Saturday night, these headphones blocked the speaker entirely and I was right next to the speaker. (Note: I was playing music through the headphones at the moment of time)

-Confort is absolutely a breeze the headphones are light so traveling with them will be a nice experience plus I can use them for hours since I didn't notice my head getting tired, the earcups fitted my ear very well though mileage may vary with others, headband width didn't even need to flex for me but it can fit for big heads. It is just comfortable all-round no denying 

-Features like sound ambient control is fantastic but all I got to say they destroyed my Galaxy buds for sure in ambient sound, the microphone is alright but could be better but it isn't a deal-breaker it works besides everything else makes up for it, touch control is the most critical point I have, quick ambient mode (Press and hold) and pause (tap twice) on the right earcup works fine but it's a bit of a hassle for volume up and down sometimes it gets confused for skipping or rewinding for other music tracks, but seems I got the hang of it now, but I advise people to be careful with the touch controls, it honestly could of have more precision but it works. USB type-C "One cable to rule them all" seriously having USB-C is a huge advantage since everything is now starting to use it from phones, laptops, tablets, Nintendo Switches, you name it, One cable for recharging all devices is just practical and reliable. the Traveling case is nice and hard and slim, also in the case, there's an airplane adapter, man for people who travel a lot by plane will or are enjoying this. and the app is simple and easy to use, but they can be used without the app but I highly recommend using the app for the headphones full advantage.

In conclusion, the Sony wh-1000xm4 is extremely good for what they are, and for my first ever luxury headphone beyond what i normally purchase these are worth every penny in the end

I recently purchased a pair of headphones from Best Buy, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with my new audio companion. The headphones in question are the Sony [Model], and they have truly exceeded my expectations in several aspects.

First and foremost, the sound quality is outstanding. The bass is deep and resonant, providing a rich foundation for all genres of music. The midrange is clear and detailed, allowing vocals and instruments to shine through with impressive clarity. The high frequencies are crisp without being overly sharp, creating a balanced and immersive listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying the intricate details of a classical composition or getting lost in the beats of my favorite electronic tracks, these Sony headphones deliver a sonic experience that is nothing short of remarkable.

Comfort is another area where these headphones excel. The over-ear design and plush ear cushions provide a comfortable fit that allows for extended listening sessions without any discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a secure yet gentle grip, and the overall build quality feels durable and well-crafted.

One of the standout features for me is the noise isolation. The Sony headphones effectively block out external noise, allowing me to enjoy my music without any distractions. Whether I'm on a noisy commute or working in a bustling coffee shop, the headphones create a private and immersive listening environment.

The wireless functionality is seamless, and I appreciate the convenience of being able to move around freely without being tethered to my device. The battery life has also proven to be reliable, lasting through long stretches of use without needing a recharge.

In terms of design, the Sony [Model] headphones have a sleek and modern aesthetic. The controls are intuitive and easy to use, and the overall look is both stylish and functional. The folding feature adds to the portability, making it easy to pack these headphones for travel.

While these headphones come with a premium price tag, I believe they are well worth the investment. The combination of exceptional sound quality, comfort, noise isolation, and wireless functionality makes them a top-tier choice for audio enthusiasts. If you're in the market for high-quality headphones that deliver an unparalleled listening experience, I highly recommend checking out the Sony [Model] at Best Buy. My music has never sounded better, and I can confidently say that these Sony headphones have elevated my audio enjoyment to new heights.

So I had done some extensive research about these headphones because I wasn’t sure if I wanted this model or the newer X5 ones.

I even considered getting the Apple headphones for a split second. Thankfully I came across someone who actually purchased these ones and let me try them on. The ones on display were a bit stretched out from constant try-ons but the person’s headphone’s were in perfect condition. Based on that experience I decided that the X4 were the most optimal choice. 

Not only because they’re comfortable all around, from the ears to the headband (something Apple’s didn’t have), but also the quality sound, the app where you can change the settings depending on the listening experience you wish to have based on the music you’re listening to. 

Although the touch feature for the controls can take a bit to get a hang of, they’re not an issue to me. 

Ever since my purchase I can’t stop wearing them and remembering music I want to listen to specifically with the headphones! 20/10 recommend
