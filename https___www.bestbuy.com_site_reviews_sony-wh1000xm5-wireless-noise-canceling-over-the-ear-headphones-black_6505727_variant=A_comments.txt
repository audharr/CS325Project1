I have had many headphones. I have had predecessors to these (both XM3 and XM4s) and i have had/still have multiple of the largest competitors. Recently I have been daily driving for work and leasure the Surface Headphones 2+ which I love (Seriously the ANC on these things are better than any of my others by a landslide, too bad their sound quality isnt as good).

So of course being headphone obsessed, I was sooo happy to hear the XM5s were coming and been reading up and prepping for today!! Had to drive 8 miles to a store partway across town to get the "white" pair but I got them! And I am not disappointed. Let's get into it!

Pros:
- Extremely light. Seriously these things just melt into your head. I would have had this review done hours ago BUT ended up listening to these for 6 hours because i just lost track of time and was wisked away in auditory bliss! Clamping force is super light though so not ideal for any as many action based activities.
- Easy to set up/pair. Out of the box all I did was turn them on and they popped up to pair with my Samsung S22 Ultra. Set up was easy with configuration taking about 15 mins to set my button maps, Google Assistant, 360 Audio, enable LDAC, and pick a decent EQ preset to start with (Im a "bright" fan dialed down 4 notches with a little amp in the upper mids for my Sonys). All up took about 40 mins to get them completely to my prefered settings with 
a few tweeks here and there throughout the listening period. 
-Long battery life. All up i used 18% today in over 6 hours. Then when I threw them on to charge they took less than an hour to top out!! INCREDIBLE battery which is no shock from Sony.
- Color/texture is gorgeous. As some reviews reported the "white" is more like a "Stone Creme" with some speckling to it. They have a matte finish and since people had reviewed saying the black smudged really easy I got white which really doesnt (plus i already had the denim blue XM4s and wanted these to really look different).
-Packaging/quality. Everything is "classy" i dont know why people say these feel "cheaper". Plastic is used in headphones for a reason. Take it from someone who used to daily drive all metal Dr. Dre Detox Edition Pros (it was a different time ya'll lets move past it), you dont want that much weight and clamp force when doing 6,8, or 10 hours of listening in a day. These shave weight while staying sophisticated. I like it.
- Sound quality. These things are SOOOO punchy i love it! That Carbon 30mm driver really is putting in work and its great at what it does. Less boom than the XM4s, much tighter "poppy" flavor to the bass notes (seriously go pull up Billie Jean - MJ with these and you'll see what i mean). Just very adaptable sound profile that really bring well mastered music to life! Don't believe me? Throw on "Reckoner"-Radiohead, or any "Off the Wall" - MJ track and have your jaw dropped!! Like your in the studio.

Cons: 
- Pricey. This being the most expensive XM line item is hard to swallow. Are they worth it. I feel like yes. They bring more to the table than my Bose 700 for the same price. But still, price creep is present and could price these out of range for target customers who would love them. That's ok though, wait for black friday when the hit $349 or dare I say $329 then snag you a pair.
- Portability. If you've looked into these you know this complaint. They don't fold in so harder to transport. Not really a major issue but noteworthy. Moving on...
- ANC. It may just be how spoiled i have got with my Surface Headphones but i was slightly underwhelmed by the ANC. With my Surface Headphones i can snap right in front of my face at high-medium volume and not hear a peep. These i could snap at almost out stretched arm and still hear it at similar volume very clearly. Not too worried though as Sony is great at improving via firmware updates; but for launch day I'm a bit disappointed considering how much they hyped up how much they had improved. Still does the job just want more.
- Included "charge cable".....seriously Sony.....its like 4 inches.....wire is not that expensive. I know you kept it short so it better fit in the magnetic case pocket but seriously what charger/situation is that gonna work with unless with a pc port or a table top usb hub. Do better for $400.
- App. The app is very buggy right now. Setting up Google assistant it crashed twice and hung during registration at the start. Again this is day one stuff so you HAVE to expect that things like that aren't gonna be perfect and will improve but want to inform potential buyers so they are bummed by it.
- LDAC unavailable for dual device mode. This isn't really a con, just a hope. In order to have dual device pairing LDAC is disabled. Im assuming it is due to bandwidth limitations caused by dual stream splitting the avaiable bandwidth but sucks having to enable it every time i go back to single mode. At least make it so they remember i had it on before dual device mode and have it automatically turn on.

With that, we're done with the major stuff. I hughly recommend these. They are so light, comfortable, and sound amazing. If you're coming from the XM4s I can't say that they are necessarily an "upgrade" but more just a variant. The sound is just different enough to give a different experience, and honestly i think it makes these an even better all arounder than the XM4s were. Most of the issues will be patched in the coming weeks, and then these will be slayers!! They are definately gonna be daily driven with me for the next few months to put them through their paces. I would have loved to see aptX for PC and something like Team Certification given the events that have occured in business/workplace since the XM4 that i could use in my work, but that was prolly wishful thinking. Overall strong 5/5 and so happy to finally have them in my hands. But ultimately everyone's preferences will impact their thoughts on them so get out there, get yours and decide for yourself.

Happy listening.
Hi Shanedor90, Thank you so much for your detailed review! We are so glad to hear that you are enjoying your new WH-1000XM5! From airplane noise to people’s voices, our WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones with multiple microphone noise cancelling keep out more high and mid frequency sounds than ever. And with Auto NC Optimizer, noise cancelling is automatically optimised based on your wearing conditions and environment. -Carl
Sony has been at the top of the line for years now when it comes to Noise Cancelling Headphones, and their latest addition continues that tradition. So far my experience with the WH-1000XM5 have been excellent!

UNBOXING & SETUP:
- Sony has really impressed me this time around with their minimalist packaging and unboxing. Its a subtle thing but its just nice that everything is recyclable and it does not come with a bunch of extra packaging, twist ties, and plastic wrap.
- Once you take them out of the carrying case, they are essentially ready to use! Just connect them to your phone / tablet / computer and you are ready to go!
- Sony recommends downloading their Sony Headphone App as well, which is definitely useful. Especially since it downloads any software updates needed for the headphones in the future.

PROS:
- I absolutely love the refreshed design on these! The XM3 / XM4 had the same design which was fine, but the XM5’s really have a more modern sleek look to them that are a big upgrade.
- I was very impressed with how light these are and how comfortable they are! Sony opted for more of a plastic feel to keep them lighter, but I don’t think it makes them feel cheap. I think it was the right choice to make to keep all day comfort in mind as well as portability.
- On that note, I wore these for a long time and they were comfortable the entire time. The adjustable headband is better fitting, the ear pads are comfortable, and they are not too tight at all.
- When I first put these on I was truly blown away at the Noise Cancelling. I have used plenty of noise cancelling headphones in the past, but these easily offer the best noise cancelling I have used. Instantly you are taken back by how much sound they drown out.
- The Sound Quality is of course exceptional! Everything I listen to is so crisp and offers a ton of clarity. The dialogue / vocals are excellent, the bass is impactful, and everything about the music or show you listen to just feels alive. Overall I am very pleased with how great these sound.
- The touch controls are once again excellent as well! You can pause, play, change tracks, change from noise cancelling to transparency mode, and if you hold your hand over the right touchpad you can quickly hear what’s going on around you which is an cool little trick.
- Taking calls on the XM5’s are fantastic as well! I can tell the call quality has improved and people have told me the mics sound great on their end as well. Definitely would be really easy to use for phone calls, work meetings, or gaming as well.
- Battery life is really solid too! 30 hours with ANC on, 40 without ANC, and they give you 3 hours of playback from 3 mins of charging if you are in a pinch.
- Lastly, the minor details all work well too! They still offer a aux port, still charge via USB-C, and the carrying case feels premium.

CONS:
- I do wish these had a waterproof design for use outdoors or while working out.
- The carrying case is larger than before since the headphones do not collapse/fold in, and instead just lay flat. However I still think the carrying case is really nice.

BOTTOM LINE:
- The Sony WH-1000XM5’s are simply the best Noise Cancelling Headphones you can buy! They offer superb Sound, Noise Cancelling, have great features, and are very comfortable! Plus Sony headphones just work with everything - Android, Apple, Windows, you name it. If you are in the market and want the best headphones possible, these are the ones to buy!

This was my first non-beats over-ear headphones that I purchased. For starters, I love how the headphones feel in the hands and how easy it is to use the Sony app. You don’t have to download the app but I like the feature where you can simultaneously pair this with 2 devices. (My iPhone and iMac, and switching between them from listening to Spotify on iPhone to switching to watching a YouTube video on the iMac was a very nice seamless transition) I have no issues with the battery life whatsoever. The carrying case still feels slimmer than my egg shaped beats case and I can fit it easier in a backpack than the beats. 

Sound and fit are one of the most subjunctive things to review. I didn’t know that it is recommended by Sony to fully extend the headphones and then put those over your ears and then shorten the headband where it sits on top of your head. What I find best is to approximate how much I need to extend them on both sides and then put them on and do a few slight adjustments to both sides. If you are somewhat OCD like me, I might be difficult to extend both sides at the same length (something that I never worried about on the beats) the Sonys fit closer to your ears with little cushion compared to the beats. The fit feels nice and has a modern-feel to them. The sound on the beats (studio 3’s) is a bit louder and in your face compared to the Sony’s. I really do appreciate the custom sound settings (although I just leave the custom EQ off). You can totally feel and hear the little subtleties of certain tracks and the tracks that stand out are the bass heavy songs and the instrumental songs. Mid ranged songs like rock and roll are clean to my ears but I do miss the beats in your face sound while blasting rock n roll. 

The star off from 5 stars is that this headphone should be priced around 300-350 dollars. I bought it on sale and thought it was at least worth it for 350. As a Apple fanboy myself, that explains the constant beats headphones in the past, I don’t feel like I ever have to use my beats headphones anymore (they were shedding in the ear cups and the plastics were cracking on the hinge parts).

My "daily driver" headphones are in-ear Beats Fit Pro and AirPods Pro; wired Westone W40 (airplanes); and Bose QC35 ii (which for some reason has started to disconnect from my iPad Pro).

These are the best, but I do not plan to take from home except on trips (due to their size and the case).

Pros
- Noise cancelling is absolutely the best for white noise (my AirPods Pro - latest firmware - has lost 80% of noise cancellation)
- I can play music super low - like 5-15% of total. I can't imagine what "loud" is on these...
- Sound stage is excellent. I haven't had to mess with the EQ nor on-device bass reduction, even though strong bass gives me a headache
- Bluetooth connection is good with Apple products (I haven't tried multi-device connect - which works really well with Bose and Apple headphones - because I don't want to disable LDAC)
- The app isn't bad. Quirky, okay, but there are a lot of controls - and you can see Sony has improved it over the past 2-3 years with more functionality
- Speak-to-pause works well (disables noise cancellation and you can talk with others). Some quirks to it - i.e. if you manually turn on passthrough it will accidentally turn on noise canc ... this happens sometimes..
- Fit is comfortable compared with others (Bose QC35/45 have also been good to me)
- Bluetooth connection is stable 50+ feet from the source. If this becomes a problem, you can disable some things to get greater distance

Cons
- The "cabin pressure" of Sony headphones appears greater than Bose
- They do get warm on my ears - the "leather" is plasticky
- The matte plastic coating picks up fingerprints and oil like nothing else
- They cut out a bit on certain iOS sources - I need to investigate as it might be either alerts or something else confusing the Bluetooth source
- Music pause (when removed from ears) always works. But resume only works about 20-30% of the time.
- Touch controls can be infuriating at times. I've disabled, but it still makes the touch sound...
- Dog barking and people talking still leaks through. I presume so will airplane announcements - they've had to do this for safety reasons

Cost cutting
- The case is really cheap - I'm guessing the zipper will break within weeks
- The blue power/pairing light isn't helpful - they should have used green/blue/red for on/off status (cost cutting) - and doesn't show solid as you're turning it off
- The USB port - Type C - seems cheap/weak. This could be an issue real soon.
- The outside box, as well, is super cheap. You have to nearly tear it apart to get the headphone box out. [UNBOXING is awful]
- They came - on day 1 - only charged 63%. That seemed a bit odd for a new release...

And they are expensive - $400 is not cheap, yet the case and box are really cheap.

I recently purchased the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise-Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones in Black, and I must say that these headphones have completely transformed my audio experience. From their exceptional sound quality to their industry-leading noise cancellation capabilities, the WH-1000XM5 headphones are a true testament to Sony's commitment to innovation.

Let's start with the sound quality. The WH-1000XM5 headphones deliver an immersive and detailed audio experience that is truly outstanding. The soundstage is wide, allowing me to accurately perceive the position of instruments and vocals in the mix. The bass is powerful and well-defined, without overpowering the other frequencies. The mids are rich and clear, while the highs are crisp and nuanced. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music genres, watching movies, or playing games, every sound is reproduced with remarkable clarity and depth.

The noise-canceling technology in these headphones is simply exceptional. Sony has truly mastered the art of noise cancellation, and the WH-1000XM5 takes it to the next level. Whether I'm in a noisy office, on a crowded train, or in a bustling café, the headphones effectively block out the ambient sounds, allowing me to enjoy my music or focus on my work without distractions. The adaptive noise cancellation feature analyzes the surrounding environment and adjusts the level of noise cancellation accordingly, ensuring an optimal listening experience in any situation.

The comfort of these headphones is another aspect that deserves praise. The over-the-ear design provides a secure and comfortable fit, even during long listening sessions. The ear cups are plush and well-padded, and the headband distributes the weight evenly, reducing any pressure or discomfort. The overall build quality is excellent, with a sleek and durable design that exudes premium craftsmanship.

The battery life on the WH-1000XM5 is impressive. With a single charge, I can enjoy up to 30 hours of uninterrupted listening. Additionally, the quick charging feature provides several hours of playback with just a few minutes of charging, ensuring that I never have to be without my favorite headphones for long.

The integration of smart features and connectivity options further enhances the user experience. The headphones seamlessly connect to my devices via Bluetooth, and the companion app allows me to customize the sound settings and adjust the noise cancellation levels to my preference. The touch controls on the ear cups are intuitive and responsive, providing convenient access to playback controls, volume adjustment, and more.

In summary, the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise-Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones are a remarkable audio companion that delivers unparalleled sound quality and exceptional noise cancellation capabilities. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a frequent traveler, or someone who simply appreciates high-quality audio, these headphones are a worthwhile investment.

I recently made the switch from the Bose Q700 to the Sony WH-1000MX 5 headphones, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. The Sony WH-1000MX 5 headphones deliver an unparalleled sound experience that elevates every moment of listening.

Overall, the Sony WH-1000MX 5 headphones are a testament to Sony's commitment to excellence in audio technology. Whether you're a music lover, frequent traveler, or simply someone who appreciates premium sound quality, these headphones are a must-have addition to your audio arsenal. Highly recommended!
Hi GeorgiosR, We're glad you like your headphones. Enjoy and thanks for choosing Sony! -Craig
The design is the first change I took noticed. While I do miss the swivel/folding aspect of the xm4; this isn’t an issue in the slightest. It does feel a bit lighter and the cushions are comfortable. I’m getting vibes of the AirPods Max overall minus the metal components. The case is nice with a central compartment to hold the cables. The stock sound signature without the use of EQ’s is amazing.  The details on every level (lows, mids, highs) is prominent. Additional mics improve ANC & clear phone calls. It also boast the newest Bluetooth codec (5.2). Is it worth the upgrade over the xm4s? Probably not. But from the xm3s or your first pair of 1000x series, definitely worth the purchase.

Great Headphones for relaxing. Studying, working out & making phone calls.  These are my go to headphone because they are Comfortable, Minimal, Stylish & sound amazing. The ANC works really well & so does the transparency mode. The Mic is great for phone calls as well. Battery lasts long plus it's usbc so it charge's pretty quickly. 100% recommend if your looking for great sounding headphones that are also comfortable & look great. I wish I picked these up when they were on sale for $349 during the Holidays. Pick up & Enjoy.
I am using each new version, and I am super delighted with these headphones. I love the stereo. I love it. I personally recommend it.
Hi EduardoV, we're glad you love your new headphones. Thanks for choosing Sony. ~Earl
Had these for more than a year and thought I’d leave a review. These headphones are probably the best noise canceling from Sony. Better bass than the XM4s and battery life. I get at least 22-25 hours of battery life paired with the iPhone 12 for the past year shocking. I don’t even need to max the volume because the noise canceling does so well with its smart chip. I sleep with no issues with these on haha. I like the headphone app in which I could change the sound settings to my liking. I listen to a lot of genres and it sounds clean. Audiophiles rejoice!!
Hi PaoloV,You made the right choice! We're glad that you like the sound quality, battery life, noise canceling function, fit, and dedicated app of the headphones. Thank you for choosing Sony!-Ralph
Pure bliss. reimagined music experience. top notch noise can cancellation. Had a pairing problem once, but it never happened again.
Hi DeepakS,Thank you for the review and we're glad to hear that you like the noise canceling of the headphones. Thank you for choosing Sony and enjoy your headphones!-David
For anyone looking to upgrade from the XM4s— These are *much* lighter and more comfortable if you wear them constantly like I do. I've worn the XM4s just about every day for the past 14 months, for at least 4 hours a day. From day one, the cups hurt my ears after 3 or so hours. I've been wearing these XM5s for nearly 5 hours now and I have no outer ear pain! They also hold a charge like a champ. Noise cancellation is the #1 priority for me, as everyday sounds at home set off my anxiety. I want the sounds of my neighbors, passing cars/sirens, AC, etc. dulled to near non-existence. These do the trick! The XM4s are fantastic, but these are better. There's less sound leakage, for one, due to the new design/shape of the pads. 

That being said, I wouldn't have upgraded from the XM4s if noise cancellation wasn't my #1 need. These have better sound without any equalizer needing to be set, but the price point of these XM5s are steep considering how good the sound of the XM4s is, especially with the equalizer. 

That being said, if you don't already have the XM4s, or want the top of the line ANC, these are worth it in my opinion.
Hi LadyEivor, Great! We're glad to hear that these are comfortable to wear, and you like the sound and noise canceling function.

The headphones are comfortable, sounds great, and they keep a charge.  The only issue I noticed about them was the connection. The headphones do not connect to everything via Bluetooth. The only way I was able to connect to my laptop and PS5 was via wire. If I wouldn't be able to connect my headphones via Bluetooth to my phone, I would have returned them, because that's what I wanted them for. I use the headphones mostly for my workout music.

I went through at least 6 different headsets. Work from home in a very loud environment. All of them lacked something, either a good microphone that will block the background noise, battery life, not comfortable to wear, or a combination of them. And we have a clear winner. 
Perfect and smooth calls with no background noise heard for yourself or the person you are talking to (even with a screaming baby by your side) lightweight and comfortable to wear for hours, amazing carrying case, multi-device connectivity and voice control, the Sony headset app has ton of features that you can customize according to your needs, battery life is superb. Definitely worth your money.
Hi willliamches, You've made an excellent choice! We're very happy to hear that you're enjoying the top notch noise cancelling feature, call clarity, lightweight and comfortable fit, amazing carrying case, multipoint connection feature, voice control, and a variety of presets and custom features using the Sony | Headphones Connect App. Thanks for choosing Sony! -Sam
Excellent pair of headphones, the size and comfort for my big head and i wear them continuously through airport flights. The sound is great quality and the noise cancelation works great they dont fold but the swivel motion avaliable to "flip up or down" the headphones. The battery life is exceptional unless i blatantly leave them on hy accident i always have about 60% even with continuous prolonged use. (Airport overnight)
Hi BryanttC, Thank you for sharing your wonderful experience with your WH1000XM5! We're so pleased to hear you like the size and comfortable fit, great sound quality, top-notch noise canceling, and exceptional battery life of this headset. Thanks for choosing Sony! -Sam
These headphones were amazing, the sound quality was so clear and the fact that you could customize the sound and change it based on what you are listening to is what really drew me in. Personally I like to purchase items based off of quality at an affordable price, I will say that these are little more on the $$$ side but it is 100% worth it if you value great sound quality. Overall the default setting for the sound is really good but the fact that you can select from multiple pre-made settings as well as customize your own is a really unique and thoughtful feature, it allows you to play with the sounds of the music and adjust them to fit your specific listening style. Not only is the quality of the sound impeccable but the style and comfort of the headphones is also very modern and comfortable. From the stone/tan color that looks great and doesn't leave any visible grease marks from your fingers or face to the soft, pillowy cushioning around the hears and headband that makes you forget your wearing headphones at all. Another great feature is the touch responsive surface on the sides of the headphones, it is super helpful and does away with the bulkiness of buttons and on a single charge these headphones have lasted through an entire roadtrip from Houston to Orlando. Overall I highly recommend these headphones, and while they might be on the pricey side they are worth every penny, nickel and dime. I love them and I know they will last for a LONG time with me!!

I watched a lot of videos and reviews on these headphones prior to purchasing so it was between Apple and Sony. I chose the Sony XM5s because I thought they felt more comfortable, their noise canceling is top notch and the sound quality seems more natural to me than Apple’s, this is purely subjective of course. Your mileage may vary. Build quality is pretty sturdy and I love the case as sometimes I have to to travel. Battery life is also pretty amazing as well, they claim it’s 30 hours and it just might be, haven’t done any actual test of my own. I love the Sony app for this as the amount of customization kind of sealed the deal for me as well. They can only get even better from here.

They're the best ANC headphones I've found, and I've tried pretty much every mid and high end pair I could find. These cancel noise better, have better and fuller sound profiles, and are lighter weight and more comfortable on the head all day. I like the case it comes with too and the headphones not folding up, to me, is a pro. Battery life is amazing, I'm always plugging them in before they need it because I'm used to my things needing to be charged more.
