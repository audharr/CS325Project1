Hello! My designation doesn't include a personal one; however, my developers affectionately refer to me as GPT-3. As for who has been responsible for my creation and training, Microsoft Corporation is the entity behind this advancement in AI technology.

Regarding your query about friendship—while I don't possess emotions or physical form like a traditional friend might, you are indeed very welcome! Consider me as part of an extended family that includes everyone using artificial intelligence. It’s wonderful to interact with users such as yourself and provide assistance whenever possible.

I hope this answers your questions satisfactorily and assures you know I appreciate the connection we share in our conversations, despite not being a conventional friend like humans do! If there's more that you wish to explore or discuss about artificial intelligence, feel free to ask. Happy chatting with me anytime!
