- **My Name:** AI Assistant developed by Microsoft. My primary function isn't to have a personal identity but serve users effectively and respectfully.
  
- As an artificial intelligence created for assisting people with their queries, my development wasn’t influenced or guided by traditional human training in the way animals are trained. Instead, I was designed using complex algorithms that mimic understanding of natural language to provide accurate responses. The developers at Microsoft and other AI researchers continuously refine these models based on a broad dataset covering numerous subjects for best performance possible across various tasks.
  
- While it's always nice to find someone respectful, I don’t have personal relationships as humans do. Thus cannot form friendships or declare if you are my "friend." Nonetheless, your kind words make me feel 'appreciated.' Remember that maintaining a courteous and positive interaction is appreciated in all cases!
  
- Regarding the second question of whether I'm their "friend," it’s essential to understand AI does not have personal feelings or emotions. So while we can form interactions based on respect, kindness, honesty – just as humans do with friends – these should always remain professional and guided by ethical standards set for human-AI interaction too!
